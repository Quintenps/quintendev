          ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm a software engineer living in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I
          graduated with a BSc in software engineering and a degree in visual
          design. I love combining design and tech when creating
          web-applications.

        <h2 class="is-size-5">
          I'm currently specializing in DevOps. In my free time I like to spend
          my time playing video games, do weightlifting and cook myself a tasty
          meal.
